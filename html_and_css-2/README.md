# Intro To CSS Styles II

## Introduction

Welcome to our immersive lesson designed to deepen your understanding of CSS and its ability to transform web pages from simple text documents to visually engaging and structured presentations. Today, we're going beyond the basics to focus on two crucial aspects that will enhance your web development skills:

- **Overwriting user agent CSS rules by utilizing resets:** Learn how to create a consistent baseline across different browsers, ensuring your design looks as intended, regardless of the user's choice of browser.
- **Mastering CSS selectors:** Delve into the power of selectors to precisely target and style elements, elevating your ability to craft sophisticated and dynamic web pages.

Our practical workshop will revolve around an HTML file, structured to represent a sample website with various components such as a header, navigation, content sections, and a footer. Embedded within this file, you'll find carefully placed comments that relate to our lesson's objectives, guiding you through a series of hands-on coding activities.

As we progress through the lesson, you'll engage in live coding exercises, applying your newfound knowledge to override default browser styles and utilize an array of CSS selectors. Witness the transformation of a plain HTML document into a visually appealing and well-structured web page right before your eyes.

## Core Competencies

1. Overwriting user agent CSS rules by utilizing resets
2. CSS selectors

## Interactive Project: Using CSS Selectors and Utilizing Resets

This README accompanies the interactive CSS lesson HTML file. It breaks down each exercise, explaining its purpose and how it can be approached, including sample code solutions.

## Exercise 1 & 2: CSS Reset

### Relevance:
CSS resets help in creating a consistent styling baseline across different browsers by removing default browser styling. This ensures that your web design looks the same, regardless of the browser used to view it.

### Solution:
```css
/* CSS Reset - Meyerweb Reset or any preferred reset */
html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var,
b, u, i, center,
dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td,
article, aside, canvas, details, embed, 
figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup, 
menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary,
time, mark, audio, video {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    font-size: 100%;
    font: inherit;
    vertical-align: baseline;
}
/* Continue with reset styles... */
```

## Exercise 3: Basic CSS Selectors

### Relevance:
Understanding CSS selectors is crucial for targeting and styling HTML elements. This exercise introduces basic selectors.

### Solution:
```css
/* Element selector */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

/* Class selector */
.nav-item {
    font-weight: bold;
}

/* ID selector */
#selectors {
    color: blue;
}
```

## Exercise 4: Importance of CSS Reset

### Relevance:
This part emphasizes observing the differences made by applying a CSS reset. It helps in understanding the impact of resetting browser default styles.

### Suggested Discussion:
Discuss with students how the appearance of elements changes before and after applying the CSS reset. Highlight the consistency achieved across different browsers.

## Exercise 5: Using Class Selectors

### Relevance:
Class selectors are versatile and widely used in CSS for targeting multiple elements sharing the same class attribute.

### Solution:
```css
.nav-item {
    color: navy;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

## Exercise 6: Advanced CSS Selectors

### Relevance:
Delving deeper into CSS selectors, this exercise focuses on more advanced usage, such as attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.

### Solution:
```css
/* Attribute selector */
input[type="text"] {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

/* Pseudo-class */
.nav-item:hover {
    background-color: lightgray;
}

/* Pseudo-element */
p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

## Exercise 7: Element Selectors

### Relevance:
Element selectors allow you to apply styles directly to HTML tags, affecting all instances of those tags.

### Solution:
```css
section {
    margin: 20px 0;
    padding: 15px;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

p {
    line-height: 1.6;
}
```

## Exercise 8: ID Selectors

### Relevance:
ID selectors provide a way to style elements uniquely identified by their ID attribute. They are more specific than class selectors and should be used sparingly.

### Solution:
```css
#selectors {
    background-color: lightyellow;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

## Exercise 9: Descendant and Child Selectors

### Relevance:
Descendant and child selectors enable you to target elements that are nested within other elements, offering precise control over the styling of complex document structures.

### Solution:
```css
/* Descendant selector */
footer p {
    color: gray;
}

/* Child selector */
footer > p {
    font-size: 0.9em;
}
```
